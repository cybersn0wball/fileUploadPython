Idk why you'd want to use it anywhere else but CTF's. Personally i just wouldn't recommend it.

## Executor
Tries to upload a php shell and execute it. Addictionally can bypass some of the server-side filters, if they whitelist/blacklist some php extensions.
Note: Bruteforce function does fulfill its purpouse, but it is really messy and uploads many files to the server so keep that in mind.
